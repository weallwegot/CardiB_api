Moving down the streams of my lifetime 
Pulls the fascination in my sleeve 
Cooling off the fire of my longing 
Boiling off my cold within his heat 
Melting down the walls of inhibition 
Evaporating all of my fears 
Baptizing me into complete submission 
Dissolving my condition with his tears 

He's just like the water 
I ain't felt this way in years 
He's just like the water 
I ain't felt this way in years 

Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing 
Floating through the space of my design 
Drowning me to find my inside sailing 
Drinking in the mainstream of his mind 
Filling up the cup of my emotions 
Spilling over into all I do 
If I only I could get lost in his ocean 
Surviving on the thought of loving you 


He's just like the water 
I ain't felt this way in years 
He's just like the water, the water 
I ain't felt this way in years 

Bathing in the fountain of his essence 
He causes my expression to remain 
Humbled on a mountain by his presence 
Washing my intentions with his name 
Sealing off the floodgates of his passions 
Saving all his liquid for his own 
Moisturizing me to satisfaction 
In my imagination? No no! 
He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours 
Drawing out my nature with his hands 
Yearning I'm so thirsty for his power 
Burning to be worthy of his land 

He's just like the water 
I ain't felt this way in years 
He's just like the water 
I ain't felt this way in years 

Cleaning me 
He's purging me 
And moving me around 
He's bathing me 
And he's claiming me 
And moving me around 
Around and around and around 
And around 
Watching me, claiming me 
Moving me around 
He's purging me 
He's been cleaning me 
And moving me around 
And around
